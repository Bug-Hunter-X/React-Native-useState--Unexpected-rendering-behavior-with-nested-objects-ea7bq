This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native with an object as the initial state.  If you try to update the state using the spread operator like this: `setMyState({...myState, someKey: newValue})` it might not re-render the component as expected.  This is because React's shallow comparison only detects changes at the top level of the object. If the object within the state is deeply nested and only a deeply nested property changes, the component may not re-render.
